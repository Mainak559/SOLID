//DRY -> DONT REPEAT YOURSELF
// Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
//This means that you should not have duplicated code. It’s easier to maintain a code that is only in one place, 
//because if you need to change something in the code, you just need to change in one place.

// KISS -> KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID
//This means that you should not have duplicated code. It’s easier to maintain a code that is only in
// one place, because if you need to change something in the code, you just need to change in one place.

//YAGNI -> You Ain’t Gonna Need It.
//Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.
//It means that you should not implement functionality just because you think that you may need it someday,
// but implement it just when you really need it. Doing that you will avoid spending time with implementations
// that were not even necessary, and maybe will never be used.
